    <h2 id="section1">Digital Annotation</h2>
    <p>One technique I consistently incorporate into my online teaching is digital annotation on lecture slides. This practice began in spring 2020, when I used an iPad as a second screen and annotated directly on slides with an Apple Pencil. Over time, I transitioned to using a Wacom drawing tablet for greater flexibility.

 </div>
  <p>Today, my setup includes three monitors: one displays the slideshow, another hosts the Zoom or Teams window—allowing me to see my students and monitor what they’re viewing—and the third holds the PowerPoint file (in speaker show type view), which I can edit live during the session. I prefer PowerPoint for annotation because it’s intuitive, highly responsive, and offers the option to save all annotations when closing the slideshow. Digital annotation effectively replaces the traditional whiteboard and dry erase marker, with a key advantage: many platforms let you save your annotations directly to the file or export them as a PDF. This makes it easy to share annotated lecture slides online and encourages students to revisit and reflect on previous lessons.

    <h2>Useful Shortcut Keys in Online Instruction</h2>
    <p>It’s not until most of your work shifts to the computer that you gain a new appreciation for keyboard shortcuts. These small keystroke combinations can significantly boost productivity and reduce friction in digital teaching environments. Whether you're toggling between applications, launching a slideshow, or muting yourself in a video call, shortcuts help streamline your workflow and maintain instructional flow.

Beyond the commonly used shortcuts like <b>Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+Z</b>, I’ve found two especially useful for online instruction:
<ul>
    <li><b>Snipping Tool (Windows Logo + Shift + S):</b> Quickly captures and shares screen content for visual explanations or feedback.</li>   
    <li><b>Split Screen (Windows Logo + Arrow Key):</b> Instantly arranges windows side by side, making it easier to multitask during live sessions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Incorporating shortcuts into your teaching routine minimizes interruptions, supports smoother transitions, and allows you to focus more on student engagement than on navigation. Sharing a few with learners and colleagues also empowers them to work more efficiently and independently in virtual settings.<br><br>
    Here are some additional keyboard shortcuts on a Winows and Mac computer</p>

    <h2>Digitizing Paper Based Materials</h2>
    <p>When the shift to fully remote teaching took place, it posed a significant challenge for many—especially some of my colleagues who were retired educators with limited experience using technology beyond checking email or printing handouts. While I was able to adapt quickly and find creative solutions, I felt a strong responsibility to support those who were struggling with the transition.
        One way I offered help was by sharing practical strategies I had discovered. Many of my colleagues had extensive collections of paper-based teaching materials but weren’t aware that these could be repurposed for the digital classroom. I introduced them to a few simple methods for digitizing their resources:
<ul>
    <li>Free scanner apps (e.g., Adobe Scan): I showed them how to use their phone’s camera as a scanner to convert printed materials into shareable PDFs.</li> 
    <li>Makeshift document cameras: For teachers who wanted to display physical materials during lessons, teachers can use a mount with a phone or webcam as a live document camera.</li>
    <li>Finding audio clips on YouTube: I helped them locate exercise recordings and listening materials online to supplement their lessons.</li>
    <li>Locating public domain texts (e.g. Project Gutenberg): I guided them toward free, online resources that could supplement their curriculum.</li>
</ul>
<p>These small interventions made a big difference in helping my colleagues feel more confident and capable in the virtual classroom.
