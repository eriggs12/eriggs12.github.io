    <h2>Learn More About Liz</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Liz and I’m an educator, serial hobbyist, proud cat mom, and lifelong learner. One of my greatest joys is blending my personal passions with my professional work, especially when it means creating meaningful, teachable moments through experiential learning. <br>
      <br>
      With my academic training as a school counselor and over fourteen years of direct teaching experience in both full and part-time roles, I've worked across the educational spectrum—from public K–12 schools to higher education and adult education programs. My primary focus has always been minimizing barriers and expanding opportunities for all learners, with a special focus on supporting students from marginalized communities and non-traditional students. <br>
      <br>I am deeply committed to the belief that highly qualified teachers are essential to student success. One of the highlights of my career has been supporting my adult ESL learners as they improve their English language skills, build confidence in navigating their local community, pursue degrees in higher education and seek out better employment opportunities.<br> 
      <br> Whether I’m in the classroom, mentoring, or exploring a new hobby, I strive to make every moment a chance to learn, grow, and give back. <br>
</p>
