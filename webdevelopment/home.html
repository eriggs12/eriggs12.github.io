    <h3>Hello and welcome! <br> <br>
        My name is Liz, and I’m so glad you’re here. This website is a dedicated space for educators seeking free, high-quality teaching materials designed specifically for adult ESL learners. </h3>
        <p>
        Whether you're a seasoned instructor or just starting out, you'll find tools, tips, and resources to support your classroom and empower your students. My passion lies in blending technology with instruction to create engaging, accessible learning experiences—and I believe that when educators share their knowledge, everyone benefits. <br>
         </p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
            The goal of this site is simple: to share knowledge and resources with a wider audience. Throughout my career, I’ve been a resource and advocate for fellow educators, and I’ve seen firsthand the lack of online teacher-created materials tailored for adult learners. That gap inspired me to build this platform <br> <br>
            Here, you’ll find tools that have worked in my own classroom—materials designed to be flexible, effective, and easy to adapt. I believe educators thrive when we collaborate, not when we reinvent the wheel. So please, take what you need, tweak what you like, and share what helps. Together, we can build a stronger, more inclusive learning community.
